This is the final project (Chapter 52) in "Learn Python the Hard Way"

As of this writing 11/26/16 I have completed the project but I have not
done any of the extra credit. The reason for the pause at this juncture
is that the task of making the HTML look better really requires a lot more
knowledge of web development in this sort of environment. Towards that end
I am going to look at django for a while and see if I can get up to speed
relatively quickly.

The additional things I want to do when I figure out the html are:
1. Research logins and create a signup system for the application, so people 
	can have logins and high scores. 
2. Complete the game map, making it as large and feature-complete as possible. 
3. Give people a “help” system that lets them ask what they can do at each room 
	in the game. 
4. Add any other features you can think of to the game. 
5. Create several “maps” and let people choose a game they want to run. 
	Your bin/ app.py engine should be able to run any map of rooms you give it, 
	so you can support multiple games. 
6. Finally, use what you learned in Exercises 48 and 49 to create a better 
	input processor. You have most of the code necessary; you just need to 
	improve the grammar and hook it up to your input form and the GameEngine.
